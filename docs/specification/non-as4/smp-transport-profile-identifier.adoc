= Peppol Dynamic Discovery using SMP

_Related to CEF eDelivery AS4 link:{base}DynamicReceiver[4.3] and link:{base}DynamicSender[4.4]._

== Transport Profile Identifier
Receiving Access Points MUST ensure that they have configured one or more P-Modes so they can receive messages for all combinations of document type and process (including scheme) identifiers referenced by AS4 endpoints (i.e. _transportProfile_ attribute has value `peppol-transport-as4-v2_0`) that they have registered in the SMP.

=== Sending Access Point
The sending Access Point MUST follow the link:{base}DynamicSender[Dynamic Sender Profile enhancement]. According to the profile enhancement, the sender MUST be able to create a FULL P-Mode using the dynamic discovery infrastructure. Peppol uses a combination of parameters found in SMP Signed Service Metadata Records to fill in the required P-Mode parameters.

The following table depicts the P-Mode Parameters that must be fetched from the SMP Record

=== Receiving Access Point
Following the guidelines provided in CEF eDelivery AS4 link:{base}DynamicReceiver[4.5], an Access Point MAY use a "generic" P-Mode to receive the registered business documents. Such a generic P-Mode only defines the parameters related to the Access Point itself but no business document specific ones.
