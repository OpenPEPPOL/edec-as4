= Feedback when receiver is not serviced

When an Access Point receives a business document, it SHOULD check whether it services the addressed participant for the specific document type id and process id, in order to be able to deliver the message. If a MSH is able to execute custom validations of the payload of a User Message during the ebMS message processing, it is RECOMMENDED that the Access Point includes the check on the addressee, document type id and process id. In case the addressed participant is not serviced for the specific document type and process by the Access Point, it MUST generate and send back an ebMS Error.

The `errorCode` attribute of the generated `Error` MUST be set to `EBMS:0004` (Other error) and its severity attribute MUST be set to `failure`. Furthermore the `errorDetail` attribute MUST have value `PEPPOL:NOT_SERVICED` to indicate that the addressed participant is not serviced by the Access Point.
