= Configuration of Transport Level Security (TLS)

_Related to CEF eDelivery AS4 link:{base}Security[3.2.6] and link:{base}Security.1[3.4.5]._

Access Points that are part of the Peppol network do not exchange information related to IPs and ports upfront of transmitting messages as described in <<CEFeDeliveryAS4>>.

In the Peppol network the access point MUST be configured according to the following:

* Receiving access points MUST support TLS according to section link:{base}Security[3.2.6] of CEF eDelivery AS4. Versions newer than TLS v1.2 might be used upon mutual agreement via the TLS handshake.
* Port *443 MUST* be used for TLS.
* Sending access points need only to allow outbound transmissions to port *443*.

TLS MUST use a valid certificate compliant with the Peppol Policy for transport security.
