= Configuration of Transport Level Security (TLS)

_Related to CEF eDelivery AS4 link:{base}Security[3.2.6] and link:{base}Security.1[3.4.5]._

Access Points that are part of the PEPPOL network do not exchange information related to IPs and ports upfront of transmitting messages as descibed in CEF eDeliverty AS4.

In the PEPPOL network the access point MUST be configured according to the following:

* Receiving access points MUST configure TLS on port *443*.
* Sending access points need only to allow outbound transmissions using port *443*.

TLS MUST use a valid certificate issued by a trusted issuing agency.
The issuing agency MUST be trusted by Oracle (Java) and Microsoft (.NET).
