= Configuration of Transport Level Security (TLS)

_Related to CEF eDelivery AS4 link:{base}Security[3.2.6] and link:{base}Security.1[3.4.5]._

Access points part of the PEPPOL network does not exchange information related to IPs and ports upfront of transmitting messages.

Receiving access points MUST configure TLS on port *443*. Sending access points need only to allow outbound transmissions using port *443*.

TLS MUST use a valid certificate issued by a trusted issuing agency. Issuing agency MUST be trusted by Oracle (Java), Mozilla and Windows (.NET).
