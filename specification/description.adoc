= Description

This document descibes how to implement AS4 in the PEPPOL network. AS4 implementations must follow the link:#ref_CEF[CEF eDelivery AS4 Profile v1.13] and aspects described in this document that further defines and restrict features and attributes that are either not profiled in the CEF specification, or they are optional and are not used in the PEPPOL network.

In short is use of AS4 in the PEPPOL network for transmission of asyncronous messages between corner 2 and corner 3 in a Four Corner Topology using the PEPPOL PKI for for signature and encryption on the message level and SMP/SML for discovery.
